## Current Sources and Definitions

Listed below are the current definitions for this data element that exist across the federal government. These definitions have been formed over years of practice within communities, sometimes involving rulemaking procedures and official public comment. In these cases, there are legitimate and sometime statutory reasons for maintaining variations across communities. For some elements, transparency will be enhanced by adjusting how data are displayed rather than defined. During the next few months, the federal community will continue to explore opportunities to refine and improve the consistent government-wide use of these data definitions, and we will update this page.

## Key Considerations in Providing Feedback

Please review the definitions above and submit your feedback to us, letting us know how these definitions currently serve (or do not serve) your organization.

For instance, awarding agency will be tracked using the Treasury Account Symbol (excluding sub-account), but the Treasury Account Symbol cannot track the sub tier agency information and office information as easily. Currently, this data is not reported to USAspending.gov for financial assistance or procurement awards. The Federal community is discussing the utility of potentially tracking and displaying this information and how best to do so.
