## Current Sources and Definitions

Listed below are the current definitions for this data element that exist across the federal government. These definitions have been formed over years of practice within communities, sometimes involving rulemaking procedures and official public comment. In these cases, there are legitimate and sometime statutory reasons for maintaining variations across communities. For some elements, transparency will be enhanced by adjusting how data are displayed rather than defined. During the next few months, the federal community will continue to explore opportunities to refine and improve the consistent government-wide use of these data definitions, and we will update this page.

Principal Place of Performance: The name of the State or territory, and county or city of performance, are indicated.<br/>
Principal Place of Performance Code: The entry is the numeric code for the principal place of performance
--the project being funded. The field contains seven positions.<br/>
State:<br/>
The first two positions (230, 231) are the numeric FIPS code for the State, territory, or the District of Columbia. A "00" code followed by five asterisks (*) indicates a multi-State project. A "00" numeric code followed by "FORGN" in the next five positions indicates the place of performance is in a foreign country.<br/>
County or city:<br/>
Positions 232 through 236 indicate the principal county or city of performance (project location).<br/>
If the project is Statewide, asterisks appear in positions 232 through 236.<br/>
If the project is countywide, or in more than one county, the three character numeric FIPS code for the county, or county of principal performance, appears in positions 234-236, preceded by two asterisks. All FAADS transactions reported on a county aggregate basis are in the countywide format.<br/>
If the principal place of performance is a particular city, the five-character numeric FIPS 55 place code is in positions 232-236.
