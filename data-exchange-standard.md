# The Data Exchange Standard

This page contains information on the data exchange standard required by the DATA Act. The standard is under active development and consists of two main parts:

1. The DATA Act Schema, or the generic model of the relationships between the data elements
2. Specific implementations of this schema in XML, JSON, and other formats (also called the taxonomy)

Currently, the working version of the standard covers a subset of financial data, but has not yet been extended to award level data. The Department of the Treasury, along with agency partners, is working to release incremental versions of the standard that regularly incorporate feedback from agencies, the public, and other stakeholders. The information on this page is a work in progress and does not represent official guidance from the U.S. Treasury on the USSGL. 

## Current Draft Version (v0.1)

This version of the data standard focuses on financial information only, and does not include award level data. As part of this initial release, there are two parts: a word document describing the schema, and an XML implementation of the schema. 

- <a href="/assets/docs/DATA_Act_Schema_v0.1.docx">DATA Act Schema description</a>
- <a href="/assets/docs/data_act_schema_v0.1.zip">Schema instance (XML version)</a>

To provide feedback on any of the above, please see our [related issue](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/fedspendingtransparency.github.io/issues/25).
