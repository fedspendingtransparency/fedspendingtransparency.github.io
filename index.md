#We Need Your Feedback!

In conjunction with the recent enactment of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) [(Pub. L. 113-101)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ101/html/PLAW-113publ101.htm) and our ongoing efforts to improve federal spending data under the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA), the federal government is working to establish government-wide financial data standards and increase the availability, accuracy, and usefulness of federal spending information.

To make sure that we implement the data standards and improvements successfully, we need feedback from stakeholders outside the federal government (that’s you). We’ve created a collaboration space to foster two-way communication and the open exchange of ideas between federal and non-federal stakeholders.

As we continue our implementation efforts, we'll be asking for your feedback. During the implementation process, you'll have many opportunities to share your insights. Interested in providing feedback? Keep reading for more information on how to get involved.

##The Timeline

Because there are so many data elements, we’ll be focusing the conversation on certain ones during three-week rounds. In each round, we'll select a different group of elements to discuss; these discussions will take place on [GitHub](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/fedspendingtransparency.github.io/issues).

Starting in March 2015, we’ll begin soliciting feedback on selected data elements. Check our GitHub page to find out which elements are currently in focus.

##How to Participate

Sharing your feedback is simple. To get started, take a look at these [lists of data elements](dataelements/). They feature the elements that are currently displayed on USAspending.gov (in accordance with the Federal Funding Accountability Transparency Act (FFATA)), along with elements that will be published in accordance with the DATA Act. As you review the lists, ask yourself whether anything is missing. Is the data defined and captured in a way that's useful to you? Do you have questions about any of the elements? We'd love to hear your impressions of the current elements and how they might be improved.

Beginning in March 2015, we’ll be using [Github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to track the conversation around and proposed changes to each data element. (If you’ve never used GitHub, you can find a great overview [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJlYiMp8FuY) here.) Each data element will have its own issue and will be tagged with a descriptive category (such as *awardee* or *account information*). To join the discussion about a certain element, simply post a comment on that element’s issue. All discussion participants will be able to read and respond to your feedback.

If you think an element is missing from this list, we’d like to know. To propose a new element, create an issue and add the tag *proposed element*. For a more in-depth guide to sharing feedback, visit our complete [How to Contribute Feedback](feedback/) page.
