# Commenting on the Data Elements

We’re glad you’d like to help improve the quality and accessibility of federal spending data. On this page, you’ll find everything you need to know about how to share your thoughts.

All of our open comment threads are hosted on GitHub. In order provide feedback on data elements, you must first create a GitHub account. Sign up for a free account at [github.com](https://github.com/join).


Each data element listed on the [data elements page](/dataelements) has a corresponding GitHub issue that’s linked in the name of the element; it’s helpful to think of each issue as a distinct comment thread. To view an element’s current discussion or to post input, click on the data element’s name – you’ll be taken to the issue page, where you can leave your feedback.


# Proposing New Elements

If you think of a data element that you’d like to see included in the standard for federal spending data, we’d love to hear about it. Please take the following steps to share your feedback about the element(s) you’d like to see created:


- Visit the [Federal Spending Transparency Github page](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/fedspendingtransparency.github.io/issues/new) and create a new issue.
- In the *Title* field, type the word **Proposed** followed by the title of your proposed element. Be descriptive, but also keep your title succinct.
- Use the comment field to add your description of your proposed element, along with your reasoning for why it should be included in the standard. If you’d like to add an image, you may do so by dragging and dropping or by uploading an image file.
- Once you’ve completed your proposed element description, hit the *Submit* button. You’re done! Thanks for sharing your idea.

You may propose as many new elements as you like. Before proposing a new element, however, please check [the current list of proposed elements](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/fedspendingtransparency.github.io/issues) to make sure someone else hasn’t already submitted a similar idea.


# Deadlines

As we work to make federal spending data clearer and more accessible, we’ll be taking into consideration many data elements. For this reason, we’ll be gathering feedback on specific groupings of elements in three-week spans. During each of these spans, we’ll request feedback on a different group of elements. As you view open issues on the issues page, you can filter the issues by milestone to see only those that are currently open for providing feedback.

Each three-week interval will have its own milestone, or deadline. Once a milestone has passed, we will close and archive the associated issues, and you’ll no longer be able to share your feedback on the included elements.

Because of this, it’s important to stay informed of the milestones and which issues will be closing soon. You may find it helpful to prioritize those elements whose issues will be closed in the near future. Please note that the team working on the spending standard is very small. Gathering feedback in three-week intervals will allow them to fully engage with your feedback.
